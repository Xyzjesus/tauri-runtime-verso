To get started with this example

1. Clone [`verso`](https://github.com/versotile-org/verso) to this repo's parent directory
2. Build verso with `cargo build`
3. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `pnpm web:dev` to start the dev vite server
5. Run `pnpm dev` to run this Tauri app

You can take a look at `build.rs` and `tauri.conf.json` to see where it copies the versoview from, and change it to match your situation
